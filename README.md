# DPA Tracker

I felt like writing a simple tracker. There are still some issues with it.
The way how frequencies are encoded isn't ideal, there is no limiter, no compression,
no volume control, no instruments, no overtones, no envelopes, etc.

It's still kind of working though, so it's good enough for now.
There is also an (incomplete) example track. To try it out:
```
make
make play//examples/Rondo\ Alla\ Turca
```
